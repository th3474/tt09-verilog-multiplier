## How it works
We implemetented a 4x4 array. Each index of the arrays contains the product of m and q. We use the full adder module to compute each bit of the partial product.

## How to test
The input is an 8 bit hexadecimal value.
The output is the 8-bit product of the first 4 bits and last 4 bits of the input.
